# Leon's Dice-Game

In this example game, I have made a simple dice game. The main logic of this game is to generate two random number in javascript. The random number is between 1 to 6. There are totoal 6 images in this project. Based on the random number between 1 to 6, two random image source of dice will be generated and displayed in the browser. If first random number is greater than the second, then player 1 is winner.
If first random number is less than the second, then player 2 is winner.
If first random number is equal to the second, then the game is draw.
